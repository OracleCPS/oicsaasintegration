# **Lab 550 - Oracle Integration Cloud (OIC) Development Workshop**
>Â Last Updated: February 2019

New Hire Export using HCM Extract to FTP Integration

## **Introduction**

> This lab is part of a series of OIC Development workshops created to provide users with hands-on experience building functional integrations in the cloud using Oracle Integration Cloud. In this lab, we will create a schedule to retrieve a file published by Oracle Fusion HCM and then writes them to a file on an FTP server.

## **Objectives**

![](images/550/image004.png)

 **550.3.5**:Click **Next**. This will display the **Summary** tab.

![](images/550/image005.png)

**550.3.6**: Click **Done**. This will return you to the integration canvas.

![](images/550/image006.png)

On the integration canvas two icons will have been added, one for the configured HCM Cloud Adapter (**getExtractFile**) and one for the **Map to getExtractFile**

## **550.4: Map to getExtractFile**

The newly added **Map to getExtractFile** represents the input value for the HCM Cloud Adapter. This can now be configured

**550.4.1**: Click the Mapper icon (Map to getExtractFile). Click **Edit** to
open the mapper.

**550.4.2**: Select the **$schedule\_parameter\_DocumentId** from the **Sources** section and drag it to the **lastProcessedDocumentId** **Target** field. This creates a link, with the last run daate and time becoming the input value for the ATOM feed action.

![](images/550/image007.png)

Click **Close**. This will return you to the integration canvas.

## **550.5: Add WriteFile2FTP (FTP Adapter)**

The next task in the integration is to write the file to the on-premises FTP server.

**550.5.1**: In the right navigation pane, click **Invokes**. Click **FTP**, then find the FTP connection we created in 500a. Drag the connection to the *+* sign following the **Map to getExtractFile** action. The **FTP Adapter** configuration wizard is displayed

**550.5.2**: Enter `WriteFile2SFTP` in the **What do you want to call this endpoint?** field.

- Select the **ASCII** radial selection for **Select a Transfer Mode**. 
- Enter the **Output Directory** value location based on your FTP folder structure configuration. 
- Enter `newCandidateRecord%yyyMMddHH%`.pgp for **File Name Pattern**. This will result in a file named `newCandidateRecord2019031808` for a file executed on March 18th, 2018.
- Select the **No** value for **Enable PGP Security**. This assumes the file being extracted is alread encrypted

![](images/550/image009.png)

Click **Next**. This will display the **Schema** tab.

Select the **FileReference** value under the ICSFile branch on the **Source** side of the UI and drag to the **Target** value of the **FileReference** under **ICSFile**. This represents the mapping of the extracted file from the **HCM Cloud Adapter** to the input of the write action of the **FTP Adapter**.

![](images/550/image012.png)

Click **Close**, returning to the integration canvas.


## **550.6: Add assignDocID**

The final step in defining the integration is to set the last document identifier. This will be used as the starting point for the `DocumentId` for the next call when the integration is executed.

**550.6.1**: In the right navigation pane, click **Actions**
