## Lab 200: Basic Autonomous OIC Development (Hello World Integration)

## Introduction

This is the second of several labs that are part of the **Autonomous OIC Integration Development** Workshop. 

In this lab, you will learn how to create a basic 'hello world' echo service, using a basic orchestration. 

The ICS integration that we'll be building is shown in the following picture:

![](images/200/image001a.png)

Here is a description of what is happening with this integration:

SoapUI will be used to test the exposed REST API Service endpoint of the ICS integration called *UserXX Hello World* (where XX will be the Number assigned by the Instructor).  This integration has 1 connection.  The incoming message is received by the incoming *UserXX REST* REST Connection.  The integration flow will take the Input String and echo it back in the REST API response.

## Objectives

- Create your first integration to echo an input to the output 

## Required Artifacts

- The following lab and an Oracle Public Cloud account that will be supplied by your instructor.

## Login to your Oracle Cloud account

### Login to OIC Integration Home Page

>***NOTE:*** the **User Name** and **Password** values will be given to you by your instructor. See _Lab 100 **1.1.1**: Login to your Oracle Cloud Account_ for more information on how to sign into the ICS home page

![](images/200/image001.png)  

## Creating Simple Orchestration Integration

### Create a REST Connection

In this first part of the lab, we will create a connection :

Letâ€™s start by logging into the Oracle Cloud account using your allocated user (demo.user1..10)  

>**NOTE:** All the screenshots use the _demo.user10_ account. Replace the _demo.user10_ with your assigned account to validate the steps illustrated in the screenshots. 

---

**2.1** Click on the **Connection** section

![](images/200/image002.png) 

**2.2** Click on **Create** in the upper right of the screen

![](images/200/image003.png) 

**2.3** Select the **REST** Connection, by either doing a search, or by scrolling down to the **REST** connection, by clicking on the **Select** button of the **REST** connection.

![](images/200/image004.png)

**2.4** Fill in the information for the new connection 

- **Name** in the form of _UserXX REST_ where XX is the number in your allocated user.
- **Role** _Trigger_ since we going to use the connection as a trigger to start the integration

![](images/200/image005.png) 

**2.7** click **Create**

![](images/200/image006.png) 

>***Note*** The default security configuration is set to **Basic Authentication**, which by the way, is the only option available for REST trigger connections. When invoking the trigger, we will use our ICS username/password. 

**2.6** Click on **Test** 

![](images/200/image007.png)

**2.7** Click **Save**

### **Swagger Editor**	

----

**1.1** Back in a browser window, open the URL we have captured in **Activating Integration**, step **1.3**. Append ***/swagger*** - supply your username and password if asked for it.

![](images/200/image068.png)

**1.2** Copy the Swagger text displayed in the browser window, it should look similar to the following. 

```javascript
{
  "swagger" : "2.0",
  "info" : {
    "description" : "Description of the service [Title is not available at Runtime unless we store it in JCA. Need to check for Description]",

          "name" : "request-wrapper",
          "required" : false,
          "schema" : {
            "$ref" : "#/definitions/echo"
          }
        } ],
        "responses" : {
          "default" : {
            "description" : "A sample description of the Response",
            "schema" : {
              "$ref" : "#/definitions/return"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "definitions" : {
    "echo" : {
      "type" : "string"
    },
    "return" : {
      "type" : "string"
    }
  }
}
```

**1.3** Open http://editor.swagger.io 

**1.4** Open File -> Paste JSON...

![](images/200/image075.png)

**1.5** Paste the Swagger JSON in the text box, and click on **Import**

![](images/200/image076.png)

**1.6** In the editor you will see Swagger YAML. Change this text to add the security definition

![](images/200/image077.png)


- Change the code to the following, changes __marked <--__

```
swagger: '2.0'
info:
  description: >-
    Description of the service [Title is not available at Runtime unless we
    store it in JCA. Need to check for Description]
  version: '1.0'
  title: 'Title of the Service [Reference Binding Name]'
host: 'ttcics-gse00003021.integration.us2.oraclecloud.com:443'
basePath: /integration/flowapi/rest/USER10_HELLO_WORLD/v01
schemes:
  - https 
```
<-- Insert the following 
```
securityDefinitions:
  basicAuth:
    type: basic
    description: HTTP Basic Authentication. 
```
<-- Up to here
```
paths:
  /echo:
    post:
```
<-- Insert the following
```
      security:
       - basicAuth: []
```
<-- Up to here 
```
      consumes:
        - application/json
      produces:
        - application/json
      parameters:
        - in: body
          name: request-wrapper
          required: true
          schema:
            $ref: '#/definitions/echo'
      responses:
        default:
          description: A sample description of the Response
          schema:
            $ref: '#/definitions/return'
definitions:
  echo:
    type: string
  return:
    type: string

```

**1.7** Next we have change the input/out parameters

In the parameters and reponses, we have to change the definitions:

```` javascript

parameters:
        - in: body
          name: body
          description: Updated user object
          required: true
          schema:
            $ref: '#/definitions/echoBody'
      responses:
        '200':
          description: successful operation
          schema:
            $ref: '#/definitions/return'
        default:
          description: Error occured

````

And then define the schemas under definitions

```` javascript
definitions:
  echoBody:
    type: object
    properties:
      echo:
          type: string 
  return:
    type: object
    properties: 
      return:
        type: string
````

The result should be similar to the following 

```` javascript
swagger: '2.0'
info:
  description: >-
    Description of the service [Title is not available at Runtime unless we
    store it in JCA. Need to check for Description]
  version: '1.0'
  title: 'Title of the Service [Reference Binding Name]'
host: 'ttcics-gse00003021.integration.us2.oraclecloud.com:443'
basePath: /integration/flowapi/rest/USER10_HELLO_WORLD/v01
schemes:
  - https
securityDefinitions:
  basicAuth:
    type: basic
    description: HTTP Basic Authentication. 
paths:
  /echo:
    post:
      security:
       - basicAuth: []
      operationId: HelloWorld
      consumes:
        - application/json
      produces:
        - application/json
      parameters:
        - in: body
          name: body
          description: Updated user object
          required: true
          schema:
            $ref: '#/definitions/echoBody'
      responses:
        '200':
          description: successful operation
          schema:
            $ref: '#/definitions/return'
        default:
          description: Error occured
definitions:
  echoBody:
    type: object
    properties:
      echo:
          type: string 
  return:
    type: object
    properties: 
      return:
        type: string
````

**1.8** Do the authentication call

![](images/200/image081.png)

**1.9** Fill in your username and password for ICS, and click **Authenticate**

![](images/200/image082.png)

**1.10** Click **Try this operation**

![](images/200/image083.png)

**1.11** Fill in our **echo** value. Notice the change in the body underneath, click on **Send Request**

## Documenting APIs

Documenting the API for the activated integration can be done using Apiary among other available tools.  The use of Apiary for documenting your new API follows.

----

### **APIARY** Swagger

----

Apiary does not support Swagger (JSON) format at the moment, so we first have to convert the Swagger JSON into Swagger.

**1.1** Back in a browser window, open the URL we have captured in **Activating Integration**, step **1.3**. Append ***/swagger*** - supply your username and password if asked for it.

![](images/200/image068.png)

**1.2** Copy the Swagger text displayed in the browser window, it should look similar to the following. 

```javascript
{
  "swagger" : "2.0",
  "info" : {
    "description" : "Description of the service [Title is not available at Runtime unless we store it in JCA. Need to check for Description]",
    "version" : "1.0",
    "title" : "Title of the Service [Reference Binding Name]"
  },
  "host" : "ttcics-gse00011451.integration.us2.oraclecloud.com:443",
  "basePath" : "/integration/flowapi/rest/USERXX_HELLO_WORLD/v01",
  "schemes" : [ "https" ],
  "paths" : {
    "/echo" : {
      "post" : {
        "consumes" : [ "application/json" ],
        "produces" : [ "application/json" ],
        "parameters" : [ {
          "in" : "body",
          "name" : "request-wrapper",
          "required" : false,
          "schema" : {
            "$ref" : "#/definitions/echo"
          }
        } ],
        "responses" : {
          "default" : {
            "description" : "A sample description of the Response",
            "schema" : {
              "$ref" : "#/definitions/return"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "definitions" : {
    "echo" : {
      "type" : "string"
    },
    "return" : {
      "type" : "string"
    }
  }
}
```

**1.3** Open http://editor.swagger.io 

**1.4** Open File -> Paste JSON...

![](images/200/image075.png)

**1.5** Paste the Swagger Editor in the text box, and click on **OK** to convert JSON into YAML

![](images/200/image075b.png)

**1.6** In the editor you will see Swagger YAML. Copy this text.

![](images/200/image077.png)

**1.7** Log into APIARY 

>**Note:** Follow instructions on the APIARY website to create an account.

**1.8** Create new API, making sure to **Start your API in** _Swagger_

![](images/200/image078.png)

![](images/200/image079.png)

**1.9** Copy your selected text (from 1.6) into the editor in the left side

![](images/200/image080.png)

**1.10** Now, we have to add security definitions. 

- Change the code to the following, changes __marked <--__

```
swagger: '2.0'
info:
  description: >-
    Description of the service [Title is not available at Runtime unless we
    store it in JCA. Need to check for Description]

```
<-- Insert the following 
```
securityDefinitions:
  basicAuth:
    type: basic
    description: HTTP Basic Authentication. 
```
<-- Up to here
```
paths:
  /echo:
    post:
```
<-- Insert the following
```
      security:
       - basicAuth: []
```
<-- Up to here 
```
      consumes:
        - application/json
      produces:
        - application/json
      parameters:
        - in: body
          name: request-wrapper
          required: true
          schema:
            $ref: '#/definitions/echo'
      responses:
        default:
          description: A sample description of the Response
          schema:
            $ref: '#/definitions/return'
definitions:
  echo:
    type: string
  return:
